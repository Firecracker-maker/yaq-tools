# Welcome to yaq-tools
Over the years, as I’ve explored my voice and interests, I’ve found myself repeatedly drawn to the fascinating challenges of the data world. Data has a unique ability to teach us—its patterns, anomalies, and complexities often reveal unexpected insights. My passion lies in understanding these challenges and embracing the learning process that comes with them.

Recently, I began documenting my journey through a blog, sharing hands-on experiences in data management, 
financial insights, and career growth. Check-out my Quant Chronicle section [here](https://womenunbound.substack.com/s/quant-chronicles)

This repository, yaq-tools, serves as a safe space for me to share my thought processes. 
While technologies evolve, I believe what truly stands the test of time is our ability to deeply understand problems and approach them with clarity and curiosity. 
Here, you’ll find the reflections and approaches I’ve developed while tackling various data challenges.

Thank you for joining me on this journey—let’s explore and grow together!
